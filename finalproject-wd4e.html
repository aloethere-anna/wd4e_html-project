            <p><strong>The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois</strong> is a sweeping, multi-generational novel that intertwines the personal and collective histories of an African American family. The story centers on Ailey Pearl Garfield, who grapples with her identity and heritage while navigating the complexities of growing up in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.<br><br>The narrative alternates between Ailey's contemporary life and the ancestral stories of her family, tracing their roots back to the Indigenous Creek people, African slaves, and European colonizers. Through these intertwined stories, the novel explores themes of racism, oppression, resilience, and the search for belonging. Jeffers weaves in the works and philosophies of W.E.B. Du Bois, using his ideas about double consciousness and the African American experience as a lens through which to examine Ailey's journey and her family's history. The novel is both a tribute to Du Bois's legacy and a profound exploration of African American life, identity, and culture.</p>

            <img src="nutmeg_book.jpg" alt="The Nutmeg's Curse book cover" title="The Nutmeg's Curse">
            <p><strong>The Nutmeg's Curse: Parables for a Planet in Crisis</strong> by Amitav Ghosh is a non-fiction work that delves into the intertwined histories of colonialism, exploitation, and environmental destruction. Using the story of the nutmeg and its role in the history of global trade and imperialism as a focal point, Ghosh explores the broader impact of colonial practices on the planet's ecological and cultural landscapes. He argues that the ecological crisis we face today is rooted in the same systems of power and domination that have shaped human history for centuries. The book calls for a rethinking of humanity's relationship with nature and a recognition of the interconnectedness of all life on Earth.</p>
